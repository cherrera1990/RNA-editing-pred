This folder contains several bash scripts used for the creation of the RNA-editing datasets for both Randm Forest and Neural Networks approaches.
The bash scripts are not intended to be used in a new setting as they are, they are used just for automating some of the more cumbersome executions 
(not the whole pipeline), and in order to be used, they should be modified with the new filenames and paths within your setting
